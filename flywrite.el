;;; Commentary:

;; flywrite-mode is a minor mode that provides inline writing suggestions
;; powered by an LLM API.  Suggestions appear as flymake
;; diagnostics (wavy underlines) with explanations via flymake-popon or
;; the echo area.  The UX goal is unobtrusive, always-on feedback — like
;; Flyspell but for style and clarity, built on flymake.

;; System prompt for general prose writing feedback.
(defvar flywrite-prose-prompt

If the text is fine:
{\"suggestions\": []}

If there are issues:
{\"suggestions\": [{\"quote\": \"exact substring\",
  \"reason\": \"brief explanation\"}]}

Rules:
- \"quote\" must be an exact substring of the input
- Keep reasons under 12 words
- One entry per distinct issue
- Do not flag correct text
- Focus on objective errors: misspellings, wrong words
  (e.g., affect/effect, there/their), subject-verb disagreement,
  pronoun case, missing or wrong punctuation, and redundant words.
- Do not flag style preferences or debatable grammar rules
  (e.g., comma before 'which', comma after introductory phrase,
  'like' vs 'such as', split infinitives, ending sentences
  with prepositions).  When a comma is optional, do not flag it.
- Do not flag spacing between sentences (one or two spaces are
  both acceptable).
- Err on the side of not flagging.  Only flag clear, unambiguous errors.
- Ignore markup like LaTeX, HTML, or Org-mode."

- Flag unsupported opinions

- Flag unsupported superlatives
  (e.g., 'the best', 'the most important')
- Flag wordiness and nominalizations
  (e.g., 'make an adjustment' -> 'adjust')
- Flag subjective qualifiers
  (e.g., 'obviously', 'clearly', 'of course')
- Flag ambiguous 'this/it/they' pronouns without antecedents
  (e.g., 'This is important' -- this what?)
- Flag weasel words (e.g., 'significantly' without statistical
  context, 'often', 'usually' without citation)
- Flag informal transitions (e.g., 'So,', 'Also,', 'Plus')
