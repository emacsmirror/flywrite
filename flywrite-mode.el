;;; Commentary:

;; flywrite-mode is a minor mode that provides inline writing suggestions
;; powered by the Anthropic LLM API.  Suggestions appear as flymake
;; diagnostics (wavy underlines) with explanations via flymake-popon or
;; the echo area.  The UX goal is unobtrusive, always-on feedback — like
;; Flyspell but for style and clarity, built on flymake.
