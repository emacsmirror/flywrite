;;; flywrite-mode.el --- Inline writing suggestions via LLM -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026

;; Author: Andrew DeOrio
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1"))
;; Keywords: writing, style, grammar, flymake

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; flywrite-mode is a minor mode that provides inline writing suggestions
;; powered by an LLM API.  Suggestions appear as flymake
;; diagnostics (wavy underlines) with explanations via flymake-popon or
;; the echo area.  The UX goal is unobtrusive, always-on feedback — like
;; Flyspell but for style and clarity, built on flymake.
