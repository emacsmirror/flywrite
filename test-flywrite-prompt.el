;;; test-flywrite-prompt.el --- Prompt regression tests -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Regression tests that send text samples to a real LLM API and verify
;; each system prompt catches (or does not flag) specific writing flaws.
;; Every prompt style in `flywrite--prompt-alist' is tested.
;;
;; Requires FLYWRITE_API_KEY_ANTHROPIC env var.
;; Results are cached in test-flywrite-prompt-cache.json to avoid
;; redundant API calls.
;;
;; Run with:
;;   emacs -Q --batch -l flywrite-mode.el -l test-flywrite-prompt.el \
;;     -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
